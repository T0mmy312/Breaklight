# Mcu Research

The goals for the mcu is as low power as possible and as low cost as possible.
It also needs min. 12 Digital output for PWM bitbanging
and basic i2c buses for gyro

contestants:
- STM8L value line:
    - STM8L052R8:
        - 1.50â‚¬ / mcu
        - 64kb flash
        - 4kb ram
        - 64 pin
        - 200uA/MHz + 330uA
        - low power modes
        - input voltage max. 3.6V
- ATTiny85:
    - 8 pins
    - one i2c bus
    - platformio
    - 512 Bytes ram

ATTiny85 is probebly the best option because the very simple build and only has 8 pins two of which we need for i2c and maybe a gpio, plus the ATTiny can be connected straight to the battery.
