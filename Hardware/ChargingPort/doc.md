In this document, we discuss which charging port we will use for our backlight.  

Our requirements were that the port should be relatively water-resistant and preferably USB-C, since this connector is widely used and well supported.  



We decided to use the \[Amphenol 124019362112A USB-C port (IPX4)](https://www.mouser.at/ProductDetail/Amphenol-Commercial-Products/124019362112A?qs=l7cgNqFNU1i9CKeIXWuJiQ%3D%3D),  

which has an IPX4 rating. This means it is protected against splashing water from any direction, making it suitable for light outdoor use.
